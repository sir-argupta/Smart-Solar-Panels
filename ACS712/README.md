ACS712
======
An Arduino library to interact with the ACS712 Hall effect-based linear analog current sensor. Includes DC and RMS AC current measuring. Supports ACS712-05B, ACS712-20A, ACS712-30A sensors. Typical applications include motor control, load detection and management, switch mode power supplies, and overcurrent fault protection.

Wiring
======
### Arduino

### ESP8266
In order to use the sensor with the ESP8266, you definitely need to take care of two things:
1. You need a 5V power for the sensor (the ESP8 works on 3.3V)
2. ESP8266's ADC works in range 0-1 Volts, it means you need to use voltage divider to convert 0-5V range from sensor to 0-1V.

Methods
=======
### Constructor:
### **ACS712(** *ACS712_type* type, *uint8_t* _pin **)**
Constructor has two parameters: sensor model and analog input to which it is connected. Supported models: **ACS712_05B**, **ACS712_20A**, **ACS712_30A**

### *float* **getCurrentDC()**
This method reads the value from the current sensor and returns it.

### *float* **getCurrentAC(** *uint16_t* frequency **)**
This method allows you to measure AC voltage. Frequency is measured in Hz. By default frequency is set to 50 Hz. Method use the Root Mean Square technique for the measurement. The measurement itself takes time of one full period (1second / frequency). RMS method allow us to measure complex signals different from the perfect sine wave.

### *int* **calibrate()**
This method reads the current value of the sensor and sets it as a reference point of measurement, and then returns this value. By default, this parameter is equal to half of the maximum value on analog input - 512; however, sometimes this value may vary. It depends on the individual sensor, power issues etcâ€¦ It is better to execute this method at the beginning of each program. Note that when performing this method, no current must flow through the sensor, and since this is not always possible - there is the following method:

### *void* **setZeroPoint(** *int* _zero **)**
This method sets the obtained value as a zero point for measurements. You can use the previous method once, in order to find out zero point of your sensor and then use this method in your code to set starting point without reading sensor.

Compatibility
=============
The sensor itself and the library compatible with all 5V Arduino and Arduino-like boards. You can also use it with 3.3V boards (Pro Mini or ESP8266 chips) but you need to provide stable 5V power to sensor and put voltage divider between output of the sensor and analog input of your board.
